# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

In this challenge, I helped an up-and-coming playwright, Louise, who wanted to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, *Fever*. She has estimated a budget of over $10,000 and is understandably hesitant about jumping into her first fundraising campaign. 

### Purpose

I utilized Excel to organize, sort, and analyze crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that make a project's campaign successful. I used these insights to help Louise plan her campaign and set it up for success. Using Excel to analyze current site data will help her better understand campaigns from start to finish, and I'll be able to set up her campaign to mirror other successful ones in the same category.
	
## Analysis and Challenges

Louise’s play *Fever* came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. She wanted to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that I’ve already combed through, I’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The most successful fundraising campaigns for theater plays most typically occurred during the 2nd quarter of the year.  Thinking about this data makes sense because the 2nd quarter of the year is during the beginning of the summer season so more people have free time, are more inclined to go out to see movies,plays, and concerts. The second most successful quarter for fundraising campaigns is the 3rd quarter, which also makes sense since it is during the middle and tail end of the summer season in the United States so perhaps surrounding hype and social fatigue may have seen some of these outcomes decrease slightly across the season.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

When it comes to successful fundraisers based on percentage of campaigns that are successful, there does appear to be a middle ground or lower threshold that needs to be set first to increase funding odds.  Campaigns with goals less than $1000 failed 70% of the time even though they had the smallest fundraising goals.  This could be due to lack of structure, organization, and management often found in such low-budget productions.  Once you hit a certain level of standard and quality in your fundraising goals, the pecentage of success almost appears to flip from the under $1000 goal.  The next level of goals had their fundraising campaigns successful at a rate of over 77% and increases over a range to 94% as the goals increase in dollar amount.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Some difficulties experienced during this module challenge for me were that is was hard to conceptually grasp a lot of the actions we were doing and how/why they were important to the process or end goal.  Understanding syntax and functions require a learning curve as well.  Excel as program too, seems fragile at best to work with and induce stress due to errors, lag times, and random crashings.  Understanding and analyzing the actual data in front of me seems to be the most challenging thing for me.  I can follow directions and type the code and change the data but why and how these inputs are being used can get lost on me on occasion. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

	Campaigns released during the two summer quarters, 2nd Quarter and 3rd Quarter, have the highest percentage of successful fundraising campaigns.  This is likely due, to the summer season, increased free time, and more inclination to attend social events such as plays and musicals.  Another observation found is that there is a small spike of succesful plays in the month of October that appears to be more significant than the other non-summer months.  This is likely due to the uptick in scary or halloween based movies and plays often popular in the United States around that time period.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

An interesting conclusion is that there is a certain level of fundraising goals that needs to be established for a campaign to gain credibility and take off successfully.  Those plays with low goals and low funding more often than not end up failing or canceled.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

All of this data is pulled from the Western world.  Besides the cultural differences, observing trends in the Eastern world could provide valuable information to Louise to help make her campaign a more global phenomenon.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

It would be interesting to analyze the data of successful play campaigns by different country to observe any cultural trends that could give advantages elsewhere.  Another interesting point of data to look at would be if certain genre of plays garnered more funding and attention than other plays and how that would tie into fundraising and production levels.
